## Pull Requests

### Creating a Pull Request

This application has been designed so that people can easily expand it.
To request us to review code that you create, you will need to create a pull request.
Creating a pull request is described in
 [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

### Linting

Before creating a pull request to this application, you will want to lint it first.
This is because linting is a check that is ran when a pull request is made and cannot be merged in if it fails.

To lint, simply run `npm test`. This will lint all the TS, Vue & SCSS files within the app.

If there are any errors that can be automatically be fixed with the TS & Vue files, you can execute
 `npm run lint-and-fix` to automatically do that.
 
This project enforces LF line styles, 4 spaces and no semi-colons.
The linting will fail if this is not followed.

### File Location/Types

Please see [README: Source Structure](README.md#source-structure) for information on how files should be organised.
