# infragram

This is a React/Redux diagramming POC built by repurposing the learnredux.com app and turning it into a diagram drawer.

## installation

should be a simple `npm install` `npm start` to get the app going on localhost:7770

## important bits

the most functional code is in /client/components/*, especially Diagram, Node and Connector

## structure

There is one DIAGRAM which is made up of multiple NODES (servers) and CONNECTORS (lines between servers)
